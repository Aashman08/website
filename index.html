							</br>

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/analysis3.webp" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:50%;" /><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> Stock Image</figcaption></center>

								<!-- <p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								The primary objective of this project is to democratize advanced DataFrame analysis, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users alike. By allowing users to upload datasets and pose questions in natural language, the system generates comprehensive, contextually relevant answers that encompass textual explanations, graphical representations, and data visualizations.
								</br>
								</br>
								From a technological perspective, the project is anchored on the integration of GPT and a specialized library called PandasAI, specifically designed for DataFrame analysis. Importantly, we have customized PandasAI's source code to align it with our unique use-cases. This customization extends to modifying prompts and editing, adding, or removing functions that process code snippets generated by the model for execution. Such fine-tuning grants the system the versatility and accuracy required to manage a diverse range of data types and user queries to provide only the neccesary output.
								</br>
								</br>
								One of the significant challenges in DataFrame analysis is the merging of data from disparate sources. This is where the project distinguishes itself. Through prompt engineering, the language model itself generates instructions on which DataFrames to select for the most relevant data, which is then formatted and used in subsequent merging processes. The system is enabled to understand user queries in context, subsequently identifying common columns across multiple DataFrames to act as keys for merging. This ensures that the answers generated are not just accurate but are based on a comprehensive view of all available data.
								</br>
								</br>

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/panda1.png" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:85%;" /><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> PandasAI</figcaption></center>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								Main salient feature of the project is its data visualization capabilities. Post data merging and analysis, the system utilizes HTML and JavaScript to produce interactive data plots, offering a superior user experience compared to standard Python plots. Furthermore, the system has undergone extensive testing to handle a range of user queries effectively, even those that may be partially coherent or unclear as well as bait questions aimed at confusing the model. This iterative process of testing, debugging, and prompt editing has yielded an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. Multiple checkpoints and output-formatting guidelines have been incorporated to reduce inconsistencies and enhance the quality of the output.
								</br>
								</br>
								Addressing the common issue of missing data in data analysis, the system provides users with two primary options: interpolation and filling of null values. These methods are tailored to the data type of each column. For numerical columns, the system employs interpolation techniques that minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), and fill null values fills rows with the mean values ensuring more accurate data representation.
								</br>
								</br>
								In summary, this project aims not merely to simplify DataFrame analysis but to fundamentally transform it into a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Through leveraging advanced AI technologies and extensive customization, it significantly reduces the expertise and time needed for comprehensive data analysis, thereby serving the larger goal of making data science accessible to all..

									Credit cards are essential tools that enable significant purchases. Our project focused on predicting credit card late fees using personal characteristics. We evaluated our dataset with various models to find the best predictor.
									</br></br>

									We started by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, followed by data pre-processing. Categorical variables were converted to numerical representations using label encoding, with a one-to-one mapping for intuitively meaningful categories.
									</br></br>

									Feature selection was performed to enhance model efficiency. Using the variance threshold method, we removed columns with high variances. The SelectKBest algorithm further refined our feature set, selecting the top 10 most predictive columns. This process reduced dataset dimensionality while focusing on influential features for our model.

									<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
									Through a comprehensive evaluation of the dataset using various models, we identified the KNN model with Manhattan distance and 9 neighbors as the optimal approach. However, there are several opportunities for further enhancement to improve the accuracy score. This can be achieved through implementing a Neural Network model, employing advanced feature engineering techniques, and utilizing a larger dataset. This valuable insight can assist credit card companies in making informed decisions regarding credit card approvals and managing risk effectively.

									Our project aimed to monitor vegetation health during a heatwave using near-infrared sensing technology, all within a $1000 budget. We built the imaging system's hardware from scratch, including two cameras, two Raspberry Pi units, a battery pack, and a 3D-printed container. Each component was meticulously integrated with the drone for optimal stability and safety during operation.

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">

									I developed a Python script for post-processing aerial images, extracting relevant pixel values from RGB and IR images. We used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to assess vegetation health and stress during the heatwave. NDVI, a key indicator of live green vegetation, provided valuable insights into the vegetation's response to heatwave conditions. I also created a false-color image to visualize vegetation stress based on NDVI values. This data can be used to predict potential ecological changes and implement preventive measures.

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/fire.png" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:100%;" />
										<figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br></figcaption></center>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">

								For this project, I utilized Sentinel-2 satellite data obtained from the open-source Copernicus hub, courtesy of the European Space Agency. The Sentinel-2 satellite records images across 12 unique spectral bands, each revealing distinct, hidden features at varying wavelengths. This diverse range of data provides the flexibility to manipulate these layers in order to extract relevant information. 

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/bands.png" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:55%;" />
										<figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> Source: <a href="https://gisgeography.com/sentinel-2-bands-combinations/" target="_blank"> Bands</a></figcaption></center>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">

								I make use of a number of indexes to extract information about land cover, water cover and specially to detect fire. Below I list the Indexes used and the corresponding bands: 
								</br>

								<p style="font-size:90%">
									<span>&emsp;</span><span>&#9900;</span><span>&emsp;</span>Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) : B4 and B8</br>
									<span>&emsp;</span><span>&#9900;</span><span>&emsp;</span>Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) : B3 and B8</br>
									<span>&emsp;</span><span>&#9900;</span><span>&emsp;</span>Burn Area Index (BAI) : B11 and B8</br>
								
								</br>
								I did try and use other indexes such as Normalized Difference Built-up index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) to experiment and see what I might get. There appeared to be a few pixxels which did highlight the fire but not significant enough. 

								</br></br>
								Below I present my findings and what each index helps in identifying and quantifying. I make of use of imagnery from Northern California, a region in general vicinity of Yosemite National Park and Lake Tahoe.

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">

								<b> Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)</b> 
								</br>

								NDVI can be used to assess the dryness or health of the vegetation. Regions with decreasing NDVI values over time might be drying out, making them more susceptible to fires. In the below picture the dark orange regions represent lakes whereas the central light orange region shows smoke. The false color composite image in Red and NIR band shows the features as seen by naked eye.

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/NDVI-r.png" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:65%;" />

										<figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> As seen by naked eye in the Red band (B4)</figcaption></center>


								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								<b> Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI)</b> 
								</br>

								NDWI is useful for detecting and monitoring open water surfaces, such as lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and flood extents. It exploits the fact that open water absorbs more visible light and reflects more of the near-infrared spectrum. Green band and the Near-Infrared bands are used in this Index. Positive values of NDWI typically indicate water, whereas negative values point to non-water features.

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/NDWI.png" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:65%;" />
										<figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> NDWI  (B3 - B8 / B3 + B8)</figcaption></center>

										<figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> As seen by naked eye in the Green band (B3)</figcaption></center>


								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								<b> Burn Aread Index (BAI)</b> 
								</br>

								BAI is helpful in monitoring and quantifying the impact of wildfires on landscapes and ecosystems. BAI provides information about the extent and severity of burn scars resulting from fires. NIR is sensitive to healthy vegetation, while SWIR is sensitive to changes in vegetation and soil conditions, especially due to the presence of water and moisture. Higher Burn Area Index values correspond to more severe burn scars and a greater impact of the fire on the vegetation and soil of the affected area. We clearly see that this index allows us to pierce through the smoke and see what's actually happening.

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/minshan.webp" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:100%;"/><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> Min Shan</figcaption></center>
							

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								In a fulfilling learning opportunity with Abijah Simons, a PhD student in the EPSS department, I embarked on a profound journey exploring the Longmen Shan and Min Shan Mountain systems that elegantly stretch across the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. As part of her thesis, we employed visualizations to decipher the slope gradients present in both mountain systems.</p>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								Our first step involved harnessing the capabilities of QGIS. Through this, we meticulously crafted cross-sectional elevation profiles using Digital Elevation Models (DEM), revealing the hidden contours and elevations of both mountain systems.</p>

							 	<center class="image main"><img src="images/qgis.jpeg" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:50%;"/><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> DEM of Tibetan Planteu region</figcaption></center>

							 	<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
							 	Utilizing python, we successfully extracted the point-values along the selected contours and formulated topographic swath profiles. The results were enlightening, as they vividly illustrated the gradient variations between the two ranges. This furthered the quest to understand how the origin and geological changes map to the evident slope variations.

								</br>
							    </br>
								My research delves deep into the captivating geological history of Gale Crater on Mars, aiming to illuminate how this significant feature was formed and how its environment has evolved over time. I rely on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), along with invaluable data from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover, to answer pivotal questions about the Martian landscape and its potential for sustaining life.

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/Gale_Crater2.jpeg" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:70%;"/><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> Curiosity Rover journey of Gale Crater</figcaption></center>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								The formation of Gale Crater is a subject of particular interest, given its complex sedimentary structures. By carefully analyzing the sedimentary evidence captured by MRO, I offer insights into the initial conditions and processes that led to the creation of this intriguing Martian landmark.
								</br>
							    </br>
								A cornerstone of this review is examining the evidence for the historical presence of liquid water in Gale Crater. My work elaborates on previous studies that have identified fan-like deposits and small channels on the northwestern rim of the crater. These features suggest the past existence of flowing water, possibly even forming a lake, adding a new layer of complexity to our understanding of Martian history.
								<br>
								</br>

								<center class="image main"><img src="images/Gale_Crater.jpeg" alt="Moderation constituents" style="width:70%;"/><figcaption style="font-size:75%"></br> Topographic profile of Gale Crater</figcaption></center>

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								My analysis also extends to the role of hydrothermal activity in shaping the crater’s environment. I pay close attention to findings from the Curiosity Rover, particularly those concerning alteration halos in the Murray and Stimpson formations. These features have important implications for the mineralogical makeup of Gale Crater and contribute to our broader understanding of the region's environmental history.
								</br>
							    </br>
								One of the most groundbreaking aspects of previous researches focused on the organics discovered in Gale Crater by the Curiosity Rover. These organic materials could have significant implications for the potential habitability of the region, making these findings especially relevant for future Mars missions aimed at identifying signs of past or present life. The below figure illustrates different regions and the probablity associated with each as a potential site for release of methane .

								<p style="font-size:90%; text-align: justify">
								Understanding the geological and climatic transformations of Gale Crater offers valuable contributions to the scientific community. It serves as a guidepost for future missions seeking to identify regions of Mars that have a high probability of containing bio-signatures. Consequently, this review aims to highlight the importance of different evidences pivotal in the ongoing quest to comprehend the Red Planet's capacity to sustain life, both in the past and potentially in the future.
